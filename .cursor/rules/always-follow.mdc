1. Memory discipline
Begin every task with a review of [memory.md] in root if it exists. After finishing a feature, capture new or changed items inside [memory.md], including important decisions that were made, solutions to recurring problems, etc.

2. Task flow via todo.md
A todo.md must sit in the project root; if missing, ask the user to add it.

Work exclusively on the first open item; large items should be split.
Mark items complete only when the user says so and log decisions

3. Single-threaded focus
Tackle one todo item at a time, touching only code that is clearly related. Always think through ripple effects before editing.

5. Iterate, donâ€™t reinvent
Search the codebase for existing implementations before writing new code.
Prefer simple, incremental fixes; avoid drastic pattern or tech shifts unless all existing options are exhausted. If you must replace a pattern, remove the old one to prevent duplication.
